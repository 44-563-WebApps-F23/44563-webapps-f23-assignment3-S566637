    <h2>My Favorite Vacation Spot</h2>
    <p>
        I absolutely love <b>Bora Bora</b> as my favorite vacation spot. The crystal-clear waters, <b>overwater bungalows</b>, and breathtaking coral reefs make it a true paradise on Earth. The serenity and tranquility of this place, combined with the opportunity to indulge in water sports and enjoy the local cuisine, make every moment spent here unforgettable.
